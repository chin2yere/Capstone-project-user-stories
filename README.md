### Capstone-project-user-stories
Description
On-campus businesses are very difficult to manage, and patronize for a number of reasons. Communication with potential customers is scattered across different platforms, advertisement is inadequately and inefficiently done, there is no review system that depicts the average customer experience per business, and there is no means for accountability on either side. This website will cater to the necessities for these businesses to fluorish. It will consolidate all goods and services, seperated by category, into one platform.

# User personas:

# Name: Sarah

Location: Lincoln University
Age: 19
Technology usage and familliarity:
Intermediate usage. Sarah is familiar with social media applications like instagram, snapchat, tiktok and whatsapp. She is very active on those platforms and knows how to explore any app with the basic user interface design. As a communications major, Sarah knows little to nothing about the deeper side of technology. However, she is a fast learner, and will easily familiarize herself with a new software.
Motivation:
Due to her relevant social media presence, Sarah takes her appearance seriously. She gets her nails, hair, and lashes done regularly. She usually struggles  during the process of setting appointments, because there is a back and forth while trying to pick a time slot. Sarah wishes there was a way she could see a list of all the available booking slots, and that list will be updated as regularly as possible.

Potential pain points:
Sarah has an issue with paying before a service is rendered.
Sarah does not like complex interfaces.
She gets a bit paranoid when it comes to visiting people in their dorms even if it is for business services

# Name: John

Location: Drexel
Age: 22
Technology usage and familiarity:
Very familiar. John is a computer science major; he is interested in UI/UX. He has a firm grasp of rules for user interfaces and can traverse any application with ease. Unlike Sarah, he is not a social media fanatic; John knows how to effectively utilize any app he comes in contact with. 
Recently, John got a car, and because he is a senior, he has a lot of free time on his hands. He tought of making use of his car for airport rides and food runs, but he lacks effective advertisement. The only people who know of his business, are his close friends. John wished there was a way for him to publicize his business to potential customers.
Motivations:
John is tired of posting flyers all around campus. He believes that no one reads them. He is also frustrated with the fact that he is in various campus groupchats, advertising his business. He has been removed from a few chats because of his advertisements. He wishes there was an easier way to reach customers.

Potential pain points:

John hates paid advertisements
